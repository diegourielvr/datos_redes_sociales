And I don&#39;t want to publish it on web, only share the link of the page or section from the notebook to few people. Also, I attached some images so don&#39;t know via any storage manager of how much space is being used till now. In short, started using last week and found too many shortcomings and I am trying to figure what makes Notion great so many limitations. And support is missing esp., the ones with the team making Notion.",2024-10-02T11:18:43Z,0,Positivo
