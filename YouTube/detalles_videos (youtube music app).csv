What is goin’ on everyone? Leon checkin’ in and today we are covering the Samsung Music Application, which has some nice features baked into it. 

However, we're keeping things simple by demonstrating how to create a playlist.

This is helpful in instances such as syncing only the tracks you want to your Samsung Galaxy Watch, which we have a video about, or having that awesome track list in general. 

As always, you can find mentioned items and other items in the description below as well.

All things said… Let’s go ahead… And get into it!

The goal of this content is to help you get more out of your devices and improve your day-to-day efficiency with technology and I’m hoping to do this by providing information you can’t find anywhere else, because I use products long term that I am actually interested in!

As always, clarity and authenticity are important to the content. That being said, I did purchase this product myself and this means my interest was not influenced by free product or payment, leading to more authentic content. 

Why You Can Trust Me: I review items I am truly interested in, and buy myself or receive through brand communication, which I aim to communicate clearly & honestly.
