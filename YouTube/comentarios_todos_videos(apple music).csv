Videogame music and less coventional music tend to be missing from Apple music, espacially since it is way easier for smaller artists to upload their work to spotify than Apple Music.<br>2- It felt very lonely and isolating while listening to music on Apple Music. There is no community feel. I don&#39;t know what the people I follow listen to, I can&#39;t look up weird words and phrases and expect playlists to pop up. There are playlists that my favourite artists update every now and then that I&#39;m not privy to immediatly accessing anymore.
