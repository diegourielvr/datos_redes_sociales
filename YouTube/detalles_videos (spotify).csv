Spotify is a music streaming platform with over 50 million songs that you can listen to any time on demand.

Spotify is available on Spotify.com and on mobile and desktop apps for iOS, Android, Mac, and PC.

There are two versions of Spotify.  A free version supported by ads and you can only skip a few songs at a time. 

And there is a paid version starting at $10 a month that is ad-free and you can also skip as many songs as you like.
You can also listen offline by downloading them, meaning you don't need an internet connection to stream the music.  
There are also options for family and students.

The Spotify platform will get to know you over time and recommend music to you as you use the app more.

Inside of the Spotify app, you can create playlists and much more that we will cover in this video.
