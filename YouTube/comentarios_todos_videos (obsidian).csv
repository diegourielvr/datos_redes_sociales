Maybe Obsidian has other abilities but this video tells me nothing about them. Now we have the amazing Google NotebookLM with AI and the ability to take a video and create an audable two-person podcast-like that is able to understand what was talked about in the video. If Obsidian has that ability then I&#39;d be interested.",2024-11-26T16:34:37Z,0,Positivo

ROdw1_C1ZjQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROdw1_C1ZjQ,"Obsidian is a constant &quot;almost&quot; for me. The lack of a truly functional WYSIWYG ability to write is highly offputting to me, constantly seeing my font jump around and move, it just distracts me in a way that I can&#39;t fully explain. As if the cursor was jumping back and forth (because it kinda is.)<br><br>The second this is that I&#39;m a highly visual note taker. I use colored and stylized font a lot to make specific information stand out for rapid accessibility. Obsidian barely supports color, and you generally have to use extensions which are mauling your note with CSS code behind the scenes (and any time you edit the colored text) - plus relying on such a method removes any confidence in being able to easily migrate to another system. I get why people use markdown, I just come from a different era and use a different style.<br><br>I have tried several times over the years to migrate, but it just never works out. The compromises I need to make on my own style just aren&#39;t worth it... which is a huge shame because I love Obsidian, and the ethos of the makers and community, and the ecosystem, and the style, and everything else. I&#39;m happy to pay even... but I just can&#39;t make it work the way I need.

But that&#39;s more for users who have a bit more technical experience. There are instructions that can be found on youtube and Obsidian forums if someone wants to try. But backup your data first! To back up, copy the vault somewhere else (cloud drive, external drive or simply another folder). <br><br>Once you have git set up, it can allow you to version your files so you can revert back to an earlier version or recover a file you might have deleted. Again all of this is much easier if you already know how to use git. Their sync product is great and not horribly expensive, so if you have the money and don&#39;t like tinkering I highly suggest using Obsidian Sync instead.",2024-08-30T18:22:06Z,0,Positivo

However, if Saner ai improves their sorting and in-page creation, it should over take. <br><br>even if i just need a database centric like, say notion, which breaks when it comes to daily note taking, i still prefer time line/ calendar style sorting first, before any other more productive methods.<br><br><br>Used to pay for 1 year for amplenote, the lack of functional updates to improving the app is no go.<br><br>Amplenote&#39;s downfall is the laziness of the developers and lack of proper database and search. <br>And i agree what Shu puts across Obsidian, its just like notion, the setup is waaaaayyyyy to broad and too indepth. <br><br>Amplenote is confusing ? sure, but is it ready to use and go ?  deinitely much easier than Obsidian<br><br>Capacities is the next best alternative, but its AI or llms are absysmal in integration [ think how Apple Intelligence in notes are used, thats the kind im expecting from a paid subscriber ( no longer ) ]<br><br><br>its amazing how many negative comments, without much actionable feedback on why obsidian is suited, can be simplified, turns to sarcastically weird gaslighting.",2024-11-21T15:43:26Z,0,Positivo
