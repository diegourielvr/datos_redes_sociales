I Ditched Obsidian for THIS Note App and I'm Never Going Back!,"Obsidian is, without a doubt, one of the best note-taking apps. Its incredible customizability makes it possible for you to build your own dream note-taking system. However, my experience with it did not go well. I found myself spending so much time constantly tweaking my setup and installing hundreds of plugins that I didn't work on what I really needed to do. In the end, I just got tired of trying to build the ""perfect"" setup and decided to find a simpler alternative. There are many great alternatives like Heptabase, Capacities and Anytype, but this is the one I always found most powerful.

Obsidian Vs Simple Note | Which One to Use?,"Obsidian and Simplenote are both note-taking apps, but they serve distinct purposes and cater to different user preferences. Acting as a second brain, Obsidian store your notes, tasks, and learnings in an organized, accessible way, helping you deepen and apply your understanding over time. Simplenote is different here; it‚Äôs a minimalist note-taking app focused on simplicity and ease of use. One is known for complexity, the other one is for simplicity. But the actual winner is the users; they got note-taking apps for both preferences.
