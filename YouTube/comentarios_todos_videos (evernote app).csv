Since using Evernote, I started in 2010. I loke the font size is fine. I wish it could go smaller so I could see more on the screen. I am 62 now but still have good eye sight and have never needed glasses. I only use my desktop app to search my notes. I don&#39;t usually search on my phone as I&#39;m busy inputing data there. I don&#39;t want to hop out of the screen I&#39;m typing in. I love the search as I can llook through all my notes and find what I want. I only wish the search would work like it used to. I could search for something, and it would highlight in the notes that popped-up. Now it does not do that. I have to re-enter the search term in each note. That has ruined that functionality. Come on Bending Spoons fix that crap or at least make it a selectable option. SMH",2024-11-28T00:59:52Z,1,Positivo

I&#39;ve recently been using Apple Notes, import from Evernote exports worked reasonably well for my personal notes, not great for all web captures, but it is getting really good feature wise (though there&#39;s still no decent web capture feature).  However, but by far the biggest issue (other than no PC app and a very poor web interface) is the inability to backup and export my notes out in a usable resilient format.  At least with Evernote I can easily export the enex files, and easily open them in Joplin for example, so I know my notes are safely backed up at home and always accessible.  I can&#39;t do that with Apple Notes, it locks you in.  I&#39;m therefore back with Evernote again.  I&#39;m also glad Evernote are finally making improvements, at least partially justifying the increased subscription costs.",2024-10-26T14:44:14Z,0,Positivo
